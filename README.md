# Live-sketch-through-webcam
This program is based on openCV module in python which generates live sketch of the object detected by the webcam. Your computer must have a webcam to run this program.
There are 2 code files in this repository.
  File: code_color.py directly streams the color image of the object detected by the webcam.
  File: code.py first converts the generated color image by the webcam into grayscale, then further applies various image manipulation    techniques to process final image.
